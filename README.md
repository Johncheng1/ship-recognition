Fine-grained recognition of ships in satellite images

此工程项目是实现复杂海情条件下的船舶细粒度识别，由于所训练的模型过大，整个训练好的模型为2.6G，无法完整上传。主页上的这两幅图为实际效果图。
This project is to achieve fine-grained recognition of ships under complex sea conditions.Since the model trained is too large, the entire trained model is 2.6G and cannot be completely uploaded.The two pictures on the homepage are actual results.
